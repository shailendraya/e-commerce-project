## Serverless Backend

A serverless backend is a platform that eliminates or decreases the need for developers to handle complicated and time-consuming backend server functions. It allows developers to focus on frontend functionality and UX.

### Why serverless backend

Serverless computing comes with a variety of benefits, which traditional server-centric infrastructure or cloud-based systems cannot offer. When it comes to serverless architectures, many developers believe that these offer quick release times, more flexibility, and better scalability, all of which come at a reduced price. In the case of serverless designs, developers are free from the pressure of buying, provisioning, and handling the backend servers. But, serverless computing is not apt for every web application developer.


### Example

Back4app –> Backend as a Service

AWS Lambda –> Event-driven serverless computing platform

Kinvey –> Backend as a Service

Azure Functions –> Serverless computing service hosted by Microsoft Azure

### Pros

#### No need for server management
Even though it reads ‘serverless’, this kind of computing actually happens on servers. However, developers have nothing to do with the servers. Instead, they are dealt with by the vendor. It lessens the investment, otherwise required in DevOps, which reduces costs and makes room for a developer to develop and scale up their applications without restrictions from the server capacity.



#### Serverless systems are essentially scalable
The applications which are designed with a serverless infrastructure will automatically scale following the increase in usage or growth of the user base. If multiple instances are where an operation is required to be run, the servers of the vendor will start, run, and stop whenever necessary. 

#### Fast updates and deployments are possible
The need for doing configuration in the backend or uploading codes to servers to launch an application’s working version is not required when using a serverless system. It becomes easy for a developer to upload small codes and launch a brand new product.

### cons

#### Tougher to test and debug

It is challenging to reproduce a serverless surrounding to check the performance of code, once released. To debug becomes even tougher because developers lack the visibility of backend processes, and also since the application is separated into smaller operations.

#### Less Secure

It might not be possible, when the whole backend is run by the vendors, to completely assess their security, which can lead to issues for applications managing sensitive or personal data. Since separate physical servers are not allocated to the companies, serverless providers will mostly run code from many customers on one individual server at any given time.

#### Performance may be affected

Serverless code might require a ‘cold start’ when used because it has not been running continuously. The time required to boot may diminish performance. But, if and when a code is frequently used, the serverless provider keeps it prepared to be activated. On the other hand, a request that has not been used for some time is known as ‘cold start’
